Julia tutorial
=========

A set of IPython (Jupyter) notebooks to introduce the Julia programming language.

The notebooks are self-contained. The reader is expected to be somewhat familiar with technical computing in applied mathematics. The main aim of the notebooks is to introduce types and multiple dispatch, and a Julian way of programming. There is no comprehensive overview of syntax and features of the language.
