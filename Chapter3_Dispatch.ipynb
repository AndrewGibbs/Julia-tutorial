    "# Chapter 3. Multiple dispatch\n",
    "\n",
    "What is multiple dispatch? **Dispatch** means that Julia will call a particular version of a function, based on the types of the arguments. **Multiple dispatch** means that Julia takes the types of all of the arguments into account, not just one. **Dynamic multiple dispatch** means that the same code will always result in the same function call, regardless of whether the Julia compiler was able to infer the types of the arguments at compile-time or had to do a check (*dynamically*) at run-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is through advanced **type inference** that Julia can often skip the run-time check. If functions unambiguously map the types of their input arguments to an output type, if they are *type stable*, then Julia can follow the flow of types through your code without actually executing the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course we aim to avoid runtime type checks, because they slow the execution of our code. But we are not fanatic about it either. After all, **an interactive and dynamic programming language is mostly about convenience**. We do want to optimize the time-critical path in our code and Julia allows that, without resorting to another language for the parts that have to be fast. Outside of that path, by all means, use untyped fields and violate type-stability at will! Live your life the happy I-don't-know-about-types-and-I-do-not-want-to-know way, and enjoy it."

We do elaborate on the difference between multiple dispatch and OOP concepts like method overloading and polymorphism. But that is my bias. Note that Julia is neither the first nor the only language to offer multiple dispatch, or *multi-methods*. Other examples include Common Lisp and Dylan."

    "One important thing to remark is that option selection using singleton types makes your code type-stable. Each different singleton type yields a different type signature of the method. So, it is okay if the output type is different, for example due to using a different algorithm. (That was not the case above because I simply returned strings, but you get the point.)\n",

    "Tracking values of variables is orders of magnitude harder than tracking types. In Julia, I don't think it will happen. The performance overhead for analyzing possible values a variable might have would be immense. The only advantage seems to be that you can more easily add special cases for special values, for example to define the limit of a function at a special point.\n",

The type parameter `T` can be any [*bitstype*](http://docs.julialang.org/en/release-0.4/manual/types/#bits-types), including `Float64`, `Bool`, `Int64` and so on. Here, the compiler knows the numerical value of `T`, because it is part of the type `Val{T}`. You can do computations with `T` at compile-time. The trade-off is that each numerical value for `T` results in a new type and, hence, in more code and compilation time.\n",
